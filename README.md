  <h1 align="center"><b>Hello there, I'm Sunny ðŸ‘‹</b></h1>
</p>

I'm an aspiring quant researcher or data scientist!
   
I have a dual degree - a BA in mathematics (concentration in applied math), and BS in biochemistry, from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. And I also have a MS in [Computational and Mathematical Engineering](https://exploredegrees.stanford.edu/schoolofengineering/instituteforcomputationalandmathematicalengineering/#masterstext) with a concentration in mathematical and computational finance, at Stanford University. Currently, I'm based in Mumbai, India.
