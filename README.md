</p>

### Introduction
I'm a Senior Data Scientist with experience leading machine learning and analytics initiatives end-to-end, from framing ambiguous business problems through deploying scalable solutions that produce measurable results. At Oak Street Health, now part of CVS Health, I built and launched production ML systems in Azure Databricks and Azure ML — including a diagnostic prediction framework across 100+ disease categories that generated over $50M in revenue, and a churn reduction pipeline that retained more than 4,000 patients annually. I also optimized core ML and data workflows, reducing model training time from 14 hours to 3 hours, which allowed faster iteration and deployment cycles.

As for my academic background, I have earned:
- a MS in Computational and Mathematical Engineering from Stanford University
- a BA in Applied Mathematics from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
- a BS in Biochemistry, with a minor in Chemistry from University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign
